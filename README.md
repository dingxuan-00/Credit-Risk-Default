# Credit Risk Default Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing credit risk default using statistical methods and machine learning techniques. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical testing to understand and predict credit default patterns.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Visualization of credit risk patterns
- Conversion rate analysis
- Confidence interval calculations

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scipy.stats

## Project Structure

## Key Components
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
   - Loading the dataset
   - Handling missing values
   - Data type conversions
   - Feature encoding

2. Statistical Analysis
